#### Questions for further development:

1. What kind of comunication we can do with Miquel? Is he able to use his phone, or should there be an integrated system
   that shows the pending orders? Or maybe there's someone that can notify him? That would make sending notifications
   through SMS the easiest to implement
2. What actors & consumers exactly are we expecting for the API? For now, identified are:

- ordering customers,
- Miquel,
- users authorized to search through the orders list.
