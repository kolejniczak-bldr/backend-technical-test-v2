#### Questions and concerns for further development:

1. What kind of comunication we can do with Miquel? Is he able to use his phone, or should there be an integrated system
   that shows the pending orders? Or maybe there's someone that can notify him? That would make sending notifications
   through SMS the easiest to implement
2. What actors & consumers exactly are we expecting for the API? For now, identified are:

- ordering customers,
- Miquel,
- users authorized searching through the orders list.

3. Regarding the Orders list, for now searching is done by first and last name only. More specific search criteria is
   needed.
4. About the data usage my presumption was that the client and address are separate, meaning a person can order from
   different addresses, and that there is no accounts at the moment. This would have to be workshopped to see if the
   users need accounts.
