# 2. Using Google Java Format

Date: 2021-11-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Code style may be different with each file, and executing it manually is a time-consuming chore. A single code style had
to be chosen. There are multiple to choose from. Listing them is being skipped for brevity.

## Decision

[Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) is chosen, as the developer is most familiar with it,
and it is supported by multiple tools.

## Consequences

All code from this point onwards is formatted according to the Google Java Format. Formatting and code style guard have
to be chosen.
